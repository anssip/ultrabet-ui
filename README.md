# A sports betting website (proof of concept)

Demo betting frontend: https://ultrabet-ui.vercel.app

* Shows in-play (live) events and upcoming events in different tabs
* Live event odds and scores are update as they happen
* The backend is in my repository called `ultrabet`

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
